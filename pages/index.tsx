                Hi, ðŸ‘‹. I&apos;m Victor Ndaba, the founder of this small
                academy. Fefa is like my perfect child: the Ruby to my Matz, the
                GOT to my HBO. I created it because I don&apos;t believe that
                free and high quality have to be mutually exclusive. Among other
                things, I am primarily a self-taught software developer and I
                have had to take a lot of courses to get to where I am today. I
                noticed that there&apos;s always this pattern where most free
                courses only offer you so much and the really good ones are not
                free, and even then, they may not be enough. Which is why Fefa
                is here, to break the wheel ðŸ˜‰.
